Wishes for Command processor:
- I don't like, that CommandSave is placed before CommandCreate
- Invalid answer to library
- Command to library
- ValData and ExecData - via macros for their struct



Refactoring of Electric Net plan:
- Now it is actually output of structures; reading of tree content with immediate output is better;
- Also eliminate code doubling between interface and implementation (structs to out and to ne stored)
- Use a fast method of structures returning
- Implement checking of units by calculations
- Exceptions for only programmer's mistakes. User's mistakes are being handeled by logic
- Eliminate types' zoo - only one type for converters, many types for load, absence of bijection between storaged and showed types etc.
- Mayby replace Node_ptr with the Node (to make mutable such an operation, that is mutable for node); it’s difficicult because it’s impossible make polymorphic nodes without pointers
- Make descent calls hierarchy



Refactoring of Forest plan:
- Tracking last descendants and pointers to the next parent’s descendant and the first descendant instead the set, remove ptr;
- Unified work with roots and desces, create fictive LUCA;
- Mayby replace parent_ptr in Node’s constrcutor with the its name;
- Refactor auxiliary funcs
- Exceptions for only programmer's mistakes. User's mistakes are being handeled by logic
- Pack Forest into ciflib
- Use a fast method of structures returning
- Package ciflib on .lib or .dll
- Testing framework pack to separate library
- Needs don't allow to set some commad's arg twice
- Make descent calls hierarchy
- Implement a possibility to iterate at separate subnets
