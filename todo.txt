Wishes for Command processor:
- I don't like, that CommandSave is placed before CommandCreate



Refactoring of Commands' processor plan:
Main:
- Make as class CommandProcessor
- Use a fast method of structures returning
- Use not only name but also content during iterating at tree
- Make as static everything that can be static
- Unificate a "suggest" and "request" funs

During main:
- Use isYes and isNo everywhere it's possible
- Use functions "capitalize" wherever it's required

After main:
- Remove workarounds on the end of command.cpp file
- Make descent calls hierarchy
- Clean up line breaks

Small fixing:
- Whether replace deque with a vector?
- Implement a possibility to exit "require..." functions discarding corresponding command execution
- Implement qt as a native command with the API function isQuitCommand
- Needs to distinguish cases, when command's parameter has been typed and not typed. Needs to understand how to detect for cin, that a user is continuously pressing Enter



Wishes for user input handling:
- Add keys to params
- Unificate behavior with an undefined name of command object
- Implement long and short forms of commands
- Names of nodes must can be with spaces
- Needs supporting of any arguments' consequence everywhere it's possible
- Report error if command without args has received some args



Refactoring of Electric Net plan:
- Now it is actually output of structures; reading of tree content with immediate output is better;
- Also eliminate code doubling between interface and implementation (structs to out and to ne stored)
- Use a fast method of structures returning
- Implement checking of units by calculations
- Exceptions for only programmer's mistakes. User's mistakes are being handeled by logic
- Eliminate types' zoo - only one type for converters, many types for load, absence of bijection between storaged and showed types etc.
- Mayby replace Node_ptr with the Node (to make mutable such an operation, that is mutable for node); it’s difficicult because it’s impossible make polymorphic nodes without pointers
- Make descent calls hierarchy



Refactoring of Forest plan:
- Tracking last descendants and pointers to the next parent’s descendant and the first descendant instead the set, remove ptr;
- Unified work with roots and desces, create fictive LUCA;
- Mayby replace parent_ptr in Node’s constrcutor with the its name;
- Refactor auxiliary funcs
- Exceptions for only programmer's mistakes. User's mistakes are being handeled by logic
- Pack Forest into ciflib
- Use a fast method of structures returning
- Package ciflib on .lib or .dll
- Testing framework pack to separate library
- Needs don't allow to set some commad's arg twice
- Make descent calls hierarchy
- Implement a possibility to iterate at separate subnets
