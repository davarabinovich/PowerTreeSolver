Refactoring of Commands' processor plan:
Main:
- Make as class CommandProcessor
- Use a fast method of structures returning
- Use not only name but also content during iterating at tree
- Make as static everything that can be static
- Unificate a "suggest" and "request" funs
- Replace deque with a list?

During main:
- Use isYes and isNo everywhere it's possible
- Use functions "capitalize" wherever it's required
- Validation is possibly not required

After main:
- Command must be an abstract class
- Remove workarounds on the end of command.cpp file
- Make descent calls hierarchy
- Clean up line breaks
- Place final directives

Small fixing:
- Implement a possibility to exit "require..." functions discarding corresponding command execution
- Implement qt as a native command with the API function isQuitCommand
- Needs to distinguish cases, when command's parameter has been typed and not typed. Needs to understand how to detect for cin, that a user is continuously pressing Enter
- Do something with empty functions



Wishes for user input handling:
- Add keys to params
- Unificate behavior with an undefined name of command object
- Implement long and short forms of commands
- Names of nodes must can be with spaces
- Needs supporting of any arguments' consequence everywhere it's possible
- Report error if command without args has received some args



II. Arguments of commands
- Variant
    One unified variant structure on the base class Command. Each variant corresponds to some specified command
    
    Contra:
        - Base class will know about all its descendants. Information of each command will kept far from class of that command.
    
- Templates
    Class Command is a template. Command classes are being inherited from Commands' instance by their arguments' structures.
  
    Contra:
	    - Structs Args won't be members of the corresponding command classes  	
	
- Void pointers
    It requires an overloading of casting to arguments structure operator overloading.

	Contra:
		- Requires an exsitance of static object (args struct into the function parseArgs), that is a workaround (similar to option with members)
		- Dirty workaround

- Members of command classes
