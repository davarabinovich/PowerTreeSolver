II. Arguments of commands
- Variant
    One unified variant structure on the base class Command. Each variant corresponds to some specified command
    
    Contra:
        - Base class will know about all its descendants. Information of each command will kept far from class of that command.
    
- Templates
    Class Command is a template. Command classes are being inherited from Commands' instance by their arguments' structures.
  
    Contra:
	    - Structs Args won't be members of the corresponding command classes  	
	
- Void pointers
    It requires an overloading of casting to arguments structure operator overloading.

	Contra:
		- Requires an exsitance of static object (args struct into the function parseArgs), that is a workaround (similar to option with members)
		- Dirty workaround

- Members of command classes
