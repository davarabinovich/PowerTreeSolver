- Use GNU Bison for parsing
- Consider a cache in ElectricNet or Forest

- Use biside comparison <=> when it apprears in the lang

- Long-term and difficult considering of possible terms' mnemonics shall be eliminated
- Rework enum classes in If; Think about default NAN-values for enum classes:
	- Replace parseEnum with cast operator
	- Make as nullable

	After:
		- In parseAndRecordArgAndRemoveToken to remove argument Type & arg and use a possibility to be nullable

- Add functions for copying subnets and full sets of descendants (with converters descendants and without them)
- Ask on the forums about type polymorphism; ask colleagues

Needs supporting:
	- Parallel and serial sources' connection
